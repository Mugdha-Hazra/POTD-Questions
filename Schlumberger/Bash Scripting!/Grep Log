Given a log file named input. You have to write a bash script which prints all the lines which contains mysql commands.

Note

Assume that all the mysql commands start with mysql::.
Example:

Assume that the input has the following content:

mysql:: SELECT * FROM courses;
rails:: Course.all
mysql:: SELECT id FROM courses;
rails:: Course.pluck(:id)
Then your bash script should output the following:

mysql:: SELECT * FROM courses;
mysql:: SELECT id FROM courses;
Our engineers were able to write this much code, can you complete it for us?

cat input | grep '^mysql::' 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To complete the bash script that filters lines containing MySQL commands, you can use grep to match lines starting with mysql::. Here's the complete script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

cat input | grep '^mysql::'
Explanation:
cat input: Outputs the contents of the file input.
grep '^mysql::': Filters lines that start with mysql::. The ^ symbol indicates the start of the line, ensuring that only lines beginning with mysql:: are matched.
Usage:
Save the script: Save it as script.sh or another name of your choice.
Make it executable: Run chmod +x script.sh to make the script executable.
Execute the script: Run ./script.sh to see the output.
This script will print all lines from the input file that contain MySQL commands, as specified.
