The script you've written looks correct for the given task. It reads from a file named input, uses grep to extract all numeric sequences from the file, and prints them to the console. Here’s a quick explanation:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# This script reads from the file named 'input' and prints only the numeric parts

cat input | grep -o '[0-9]*'
Explanation:
#!/bin/bash: Specifies the script should be run in the Bash shell.
cat input: Outputs the contents of the file input.
grep -o '[0-9]*': Filters and prints only the numeric sequences found in the file.
Usage:
Save the script: Save it as a file, for example, script.sh.
Make it executable: Run chmod +x script.sh to make the script executable.
Execute the script: Run ./script.sh to see the output.
This script directly meets the requirements without additional processing or redirection.

The -o option in grep stands for "only-matching." It tells grep to print only the parts of the line that match the specified pattern, rather than printing the entire line.

Example:
If you have a file input with the following content:

Copy code
axes12
w143th
qwer
Running the command:

bash
Copy code
grep -o '[0-9]*' input
Would output:

Copy code
12
143
Here’s a breakdown:

grep '[0-9]*' input would match and print the entire lines containing numbers.
grep -o '[0-9]*' input extracts and prints only the sequences of digits from those lines.
The -o option is useful for extracting specific parts of lines that match a pattern, especially when you want only the matching text and not the entire line.
