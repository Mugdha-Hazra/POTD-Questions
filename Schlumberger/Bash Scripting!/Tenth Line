The following command prints the top 10 lines of file named input

cat input | head -n 10

The following command prints the bottom 10 lines of file named input

cat input | tail -n 10

Can you somehow use the above information to print the 10th line of the file named input ?

Example:

Assume that the input contains the following:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Line 11
Line 12
Line 13
Line 14
Line 15
Your bash script should output the following:

Line 10
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
To print the 10th line of a file named input using the cat, head, and tail commands, you can combine these utilities in a pipeline. Here's a concise way to achieve this:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

cat input | head -n 10 | tail -n 1
Explanation:
cat input: Outputs the entire content of the file input.
head -n 10: Takes the first 10 lines of the output from cat.
tail -n 1: Takes the last line from the output of head, which is the 10th line of the original file.
Usage:
Save the script: Save it as script.sh or another name of your choice.
Make it executable: Run chmod +x script.sh to make the script executable.
Execute the script: Run ./script.sh to get the 10th line of the file.
This script will print the 10th line from the input file.
